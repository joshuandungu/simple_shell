# simple_shell
A simple shell is a fundamental component of operating systems, providing users with a command-line interface to interact with the system. At its core, a simple shell reads user input, interprets commands, and executes them on behalf of the user. Designed for ease of use and efficiency, a simple shell allows users to issue various commands, navigate the file system, and launch programs. It serves as a bridge between the user and the operating system, offering a text-based interface for performing tasks such as file manipulation, process control, and system configuration. While basic in its functionality, a simple shell provides a foundation for understanding the principles of command-line interfaces and serves as a starting point for more sophisticated shell implementations found in modern operating systems.
